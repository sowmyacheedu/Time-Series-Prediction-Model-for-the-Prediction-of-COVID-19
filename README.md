# *** Time Series Prediction Model For the Prediction of COVID-19 *** #
* As of mid-May 2020, the current outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has killed over 3,00,000 individuals and infected over 4.7 million people over the world. 
* During this time, there have been over 1.8 million recoveries. It is critical for governments to be aware of the situation and to be able to forecast future patient numbers in order to maintain health-care readiness and plan for other essential steps.
* Using the Long-Sort Term Memory (LSTM) network as a driving force, a model for predicting the number of COVID–19 patients was constructed and subsequently used it for forecasting future cases.
* India's cases are taken into consideration. According to the findings, the LSTM network constructed in this paper outperforms other networks and hence could be a good contender for predicting the number of COVID–19 patients in the future.
